What is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or configuration that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or steal data. Common types include remote code execution, privilege escalation, and denial of service.

How to Stay Safe:

- Keep all software and systems updated with the latest security patches
- Use trusted sources for downloads and dependencies
- Run regular vulnerability scans using tools like Nessus
- Monitor logs for unusual activity
- Disable unused services and ports
- Apply the principle of least privilege for user accounts
- Backup critical data regularly
- Document and remediate vulnerabilities promptly

Staying proactive and audit-ready helps prevent exploitation and ensures system integrity.
